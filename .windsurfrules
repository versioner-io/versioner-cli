# Project Rules

## Documentation Strategy

**Single Source of Project/Development plan:** `docs/development-plan.md`
- This is the canonical plan tracking all phases and tasks
- Update it as you complete tasks (mark ✅, add notes, issues)
- Don't create new status files or session summaries

**Keep Documentation DRY:**
- Consolidate related information into existing docs whenever possible
- Avoid duplicate content across files
- Delete outdated or redundant docs

**Documentation Files:**
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions
- `docs/development-plan.md` - Project roadmap and status

**Other Key Files:**
- `justfile` - Setup, build and test commands

## Code Changes

**Prefer Minimal Edits:**
- Always edit existing files over creating new ones
- Follow existing code patterns and style
- Keep changes focused and scoped

**Testing:**
- Add tests for new features
- Run `just run_tests` before committing
- Ensure all tests pass

**Blank Lines:**
- Lines should not contain only whitespace
- Blank lines must be completely empty

## Session Workflow

**At Start of Session:**
1. Read the root `README.md` and `docs/development-plan.md` for current status
2. Read the remainder of the files in the docs directory
3. Find the next 🔲 TODO task
4. Ask user if ready to begin work

**During Session:**
1. Update the canonical plan with ✅ as you complete tasks
2. Add notes about issues resolved
3. Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages

**At End of Session:**
1. Ensure canonical plan is up-to-date
2. Delete any temporary files
3. Commit all changes

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test changes
- `chore:` - Build/tooling changes
